Title: Form
Description: It is a JsonPowerDB project which helps in storing the details of the employee as Employee name,Employee ID and Employee email. 
             The data is stored automatically in the Json Power Database. I have used get, put, update , remove, updateAll and getAll queries to store the data.
             Three google Api's are also used to connect the form to JsonPowerDB.
Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:
            -Easy to use
            -Realtime Datsabase
